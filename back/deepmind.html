      emotions: [
        "When you experience a strong emotion, do you believe it reflects an objective truth about the situation, or is it shaped more by your past experiences and expectations?",
        "If emotions are temporary by nature, why do some feelings seem to define entire periods of our lives?",
        "Do you think emotions exist independently within us, or are they created only through interaction with the world around us?",
        "Is it possible to fully understand an emotion while you are still experiencing it, or only in hindsight?",
        "When emotional pain arises, do you see it as something to avoid, or something that asks to be understood?",
        "Are there emotions that society encourages us to feel, and others it quietly teaches us to suppress?",
        "If you could remove one emotion from your life, would doing so change who you are at your core?",
        "Do emotions reveal who we truly are, or do they sometimes hide deeper truths about ourselves?",
        "Is emotional stability a sign of inner strength, or can emotional fluctuation also be a form of honesty?",
        "What emotion do you feel most uncomfortable examining closely, and why do you think that is?"
      ],
      relationships: [
        "In relationships, how much of what we call connection is truly mutual understanding, and how much is projection?",
        "Can we ever truly know another person, or are we always relating to our own interpretation of them?",
        "Is love something that grows through effort, or something that naturally exists until it fades?",
        "Do relationships shape who we become, or do they simply reveal parts of ourselves that were already there?",
        "Is emotional closeness built through sharing similarities, or through accepting differences?",
        "When a relationship causes pain, how do we decide whether it is something to heal or something to release?",
        "Are we responsible for the emotional well-being of those we care about, or only for our intentions?",
        "Can distance sometimes deepen a relationship more than constant presence?",
        "Is trust a conscious decision, or something that forms beyond our control?",
        "What does it mean to truly listen to another person without trying to change them?"
      ],
      self: [
        "When you think about who you are, do you feel more connected to your thoughts, your emotions, or your actions?",
        "Is the self something stable that persists over time, or something that is constantly being rewritten?",
        "How much of your identity feels chosen, and how much feels inherited or imposed?",
        "Is self-awareness a form of freedom, or can it sometimes become a burden?",
        "Can we observe ourselves honestly without changing what we observe?",
        "Do you believe there is a part of yourself that remains unchanged regardless of circumstances?",
        "Is authenticity about expressing everything we feel, or about choosing what we live by?",
        "When you are alone, does your sense of self feel clearer or more uncertain?",
        "Is it possible to lose yourself, or does the self simply transform?",
        "What part of yourself do you sense, but struggle to put into words?"
      ],
      choices: [
        "When making a choice, how much do you feel guided by freedom, and how much by unseen limitations?",
        "Is choosing not to decide truly a neutral act, or is it a decision with its own consequences?",
        "Do our choices define who we are, or do they simply express who we already believe ourselves to be?",
        "Can a choice made out of fear still lead to meaningful growth?",
        "How do you understand regret: as a sign of failure, or as evidence of reflection?",
        "Is certainty necessary before acting, or is uncertainty an unavoidable part of choosing?",
        "Do we become responsible for outcomes we could not have predicted?",
        "Is it possible to make a completely free choice, untouched by past experience?",
        "When a choice closes one path, does it truly eliminate it, or does it continue to shape us indirectly?",
        "If you could revisit one decision, would you want to change it, or simply understand it better?"
      ],
      values: [
        "Where do your core values come from: personal reflection, cultural influence, or lived experience?",
        "Are values something we discover over time, or something we consciously decide to live by?",
        "When values conflict, how do you decide which one deserves priority?",
        "Is it harder to live according to your values, or to define them clearly?",
        "Do values remain meaningful if they are never challenged?",
        "Can a value change without losing its importance?",
        "Are there values you claim to hold, but find difficult to act upon?",
        "Is moral judgment driven more by emotion or by reason?",
        "What value do you rarely question, and what might happen if you did?",
        "If your life reflected your values perfectly, what would look different?"
