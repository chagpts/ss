    <h2>6 Key Techniques to Diffuse Conflict</h2>

    <h3>1. Address the Conflict Early</h3>
    <p>Don’t wait for small issues to become big problems. Talk about them before feelings get too strong.</p>

    <h3>2. Know the Goal</h3>
    <p>Make sure both people understand what kind of outcome they want. Ask: “How will we know this is solved?”</p>

    <h3>3. Stay Calm</h3>
    <p>Keep your emotions in check before and during the conversation. Take a break if needed.</p>

    <h3>4. Practice Active Listening</h3>
    <p>Let the other person speak fully and listen carefully. Take turns talking and really understand what they feel.</p>

    <h3>5. Use “I” Statements</h3>
    <p>
      Talk about your feelings without blaming. For example, 
      <em>“I feel upset when…”</em> instead of <em>“You always…”</em>
    </p>

    <h3>6. Get Help if Needed</h3>
    <p>If you can’t solve it alone, involve a neutral third person like a mediator or counselor.</p>

    <h2>Extra Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <p>Resources That Can Help You Deal With Conflict</p>
      <p>Sometimes, you might need outside help to manage or de-escalate a conflict. Even if you take steps to diffuse the situation, the other party might not be receptive or may choose to continue to escalate regardless of your efforts.</p>
      <p>Depending on the nature of the conflict, you might benefit from additional support:</p>

      <li>
        Workplace conflict: Consult your job’s human resources department. They can intervene and help you and the other party work through the conflict in a healthy environment. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Conflict with your partner: If you and your partner are struggling with conflict, a couples therapist can help you work through it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Family conflict: If members of your family are struggling with conflict, a marriage and family therapist or another qualified mental health professional can help you work through and build appropriate communication skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conflict among friends: Even the best of friends disagree sometimes. Involving a neutral third party can help you work through the disagreement and communicate effectively.
      </li>

    </ul>
