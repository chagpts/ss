<h1>Casual Talk</h1>

<h2>The Five Love Languages</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Words of affirmation</li>
  <li>Quality time</li>
  <li>Physical touch</li>
  <li>Acts of service</li>
  <li>Receiving gifts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Words of Affirmation</h3>
<p>
“Words of affirmation” is about through spoken words, praise, or appreciation.
When this is someone's primary love language, they enjoy kind words and encouragement,
uplifting quotes, love notes, and cute text messages.
You can make this person's day by or pointing out what they do well.
</p>

<h3>Quality Time</h3>
<p>
Someone with this love language wants undivided attention.
They feel loved if you are present and focused on them when you are together.
This means putting down the cell phone, turning off the computer,
making eye contact, and actively listening.
</p>

<h3>Physical Touch</h3>
<p>
A person with physical touch as their primary love language feels love through physical affection.
Aside from sex, they feel loved when their partner holds their hand,
touches their arm, or gives them a massage at the end of the day.
</p>

<p>
This person's idea of a perfect date might include cuddling on the couch with a glass of wine
and a good movie. They simply want to be close to their partner physically.
</p>

<h3>Acts of Service</h3>
<p>
Acts of service are nice things you do for your partner that make them feel loved and appreciated, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helping with the dishes</li>
  <li>Running errands</li>
  <li>Vacuuming</li>
  <li>Putting gas in the car</li>
</ul>

<p>
If your partner's main love language is acts of service,
they'll notice and appreciate little things you do for them.
They tend to perform acts of service and kindness for others, too.
</p>

<h3>Receiving Gifts</h3>
<p>
For someone who uses and responds to this love language,
gift-giving indicates love and affection.
They treasure not only the gift itself but also the time and effort the gift-giver put into it.
</p>

<p>
People who enjoy receiving gifts as part of their primary love language do not necessarily expect
large or expensive presents; it's more the effort and thoughtfulness behind the gift that count.
</p>

<p>
When you take the time to pick out a gift specifically for them,
it tells them you really know them.
People with this love language can often remember every little gift they have received
from their loved ones because it makes such an impact on them.
</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<div class="questions">
<ul>
  <li>Which love language do you think you value the most in a relationship?</li>
  <li>When you were younger, which love language did you value the most in a relationship?</li>
  <li>How do you and your partner deal with having different love languages?</li>
  <li>
    Do you think learning about the five love languages helps you understand both your partner
    and yourself better — like what each of you likes or needs in a relationship?
  </li>
  <li>
    Which love language did you score the lowest in?
    If your partner’s main love language was different from yours, what would you do?
  </li>
</ul>
