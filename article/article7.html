<h2>When Persistence Works — and When It Makes Things Worse</h2>

<p>
We love stories about people who achieve the impossible.
Someone keeps trying despite all odds—and finally succeeds.
Persistence is often praised as a virtue.
But is continuing always the right choice?
</p>

<h3>The Power of Doing the “Impossible”</h3>

<p>
Many breakthroughs happen because someone refused to give up.
Athletes, entrepreneurs, and artists often succeed precisely because
they kept going when others quit.
</p>

<p>
In these cases, persistence turns the impossible into the possible.
Failure becomes feedback, and effort leads to growth.
</p>

<h3>When Trying Harder Backfires</h3>

<p>
However, not every difficult situation improves with more effort.
Sometimes, continuing down the same path only makes things worse.
</p>

<p>
This is known as the <strong>sunk cost trap</strong>—
we keep investing time, energy, or money simply because
we have already invested so much.
</p>

<h3>Knowing When to Stop</h3>

<p>
The real challenge is not choosing between quitting and persisting,
but knowing <em>when</em> to do each.
</p>

<p>
Walking away is not always failure.
Sometimes, it is a strategic decision that prevents further damage
and opens the door to better opportunities.
</p>

<h3>Redefining Success</h3>

<p>
Success is not just about pushing forward.
It is also about reflection, adjustment, and courage—
including the courage to change direction.
</p>

<p>
The wisest choice often lies in understanding the difference
between meaningful persistence and harmful stubbornness.
</p>

<h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

<div class="questions">
<ul>
  <li>Do you believe persistence is always a good thing? Why or why not?</li>
  <li>Can you think of a time when continuing made a situation worse?</li>
  <li>How do you personally decide when to quit versus when to keep going?</li>
  <li>Is quitting sometimes a sign of intelligence rather than weakness?</li>
  <li>How does fear (of failure or regret) affect our decisions?</li>
  <li>Have you ever stayed in a situation because of “wasted effort”?</li>
  <li>Do cultural values influence how we view quitting?</li>
  <li>How can we reframe quitting in a healthier way?</li>
  <li>What advice would you give someone stuck in a failing situation?</li>
  <li>What does “success” mean to you now compared to the past?</li>
